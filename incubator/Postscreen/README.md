#Â i-MSCP Postscreen plugin v1.0.0

Plugin which allows to use Postscreen daemon for Postfix with i-MSCP.

## Introduction

The Postfix Postscreen daemon provides additional protection against mail server overload. One Postscreen process
handles multiple inbound SMTP connections, and decides which clients may talk to a Postfix SMTP server process. By
keeping spambots away, Postscreen leaves more SMTP server processes available for legitimate clients, and delays the
onset of server overload conditions.

## Warning

Before installing this plugin, you're greatly encouraged to read the Postscreen howto for Postfix which is available at
[Postfix Postscreen Howto](http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html "Postfix Postscreen Howto")

In any case, be aware that if you use this plugin, your clients must no longer submit mails via SMTP service on TCP port
25 because it is used by the Postscreen daemon. Instead your clients must submit mails via SUBMISSION service on TCP port
587 or via SMTPS service on TCP port 465 which both require client authentication.
